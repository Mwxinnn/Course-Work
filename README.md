    - Assignment : This project aims to build a neural network model to solve the EMNIST classification problem. We implemented two types of neural network (i.e. CNN and MLP) and tried multiple parameters/techniques to obtain the best performance. We discussed the pros and cons of MLP and CNNs and analyse why a certain model outperformances another model.
